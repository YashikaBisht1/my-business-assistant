Leave Policy (v1.2)

- Employees are allowed up to 10 days of paid sick leave per year without prior approval.
- Any leave beyond 10 days in a 12-month period requires manager approval and documentation.
- Managers are required to review leave requests that exceed policy and escalate to HR if patterns of misuse are detected.

Notes: This policy applies to full-time employees; contractors follow contract terms.
