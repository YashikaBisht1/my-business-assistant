HR Guidelines for Leave and Attendance

1. Managers must investigate when an employee exceeds average leave by more than 50% over a quarter.
2. For repeated monthly anomalies, initiate a formal attendance review.
3. Any operational recommendations that affect headcount or schedules must be approved by HR and Legal.

Compliance requirement: keep records of reviews for at least 2 years.
